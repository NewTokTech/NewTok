Too many technical terms, might confuse you so, you have to aware of main terms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Server Types<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Shared Server, the cheapest option for hosting. Your site&#8217;s output depends on the load imposed on the host by all the other pages. You should not opt for this form if your website gets a lot of traffic. Due to limit resources, the amount of traffic cannot be supported because the website is on a shared server.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual Private Server Hosting is an isolated one and expensive. But it can handle significant amount of traffic that comes to your website.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not want to share output with other pages, consider a Dedicated Server, a physical box that is leased to you. Only those with experience in system administration need to apply.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) SSL Certificate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>SSL Certificate encrypts your website, so nobody can hack your website and abstract customer data.<\/p>\n<p>Some benefits:<\/p>\n<p>1. Protect the data of you and your users<br \/>\n2. Increase your search engine ranking and brand value<br \/>\n3. Secure shopping and payments<br \/>\n4. Showing your users you are trust-worthy (your domain name will start with an \u2018https:\\\\\u2019 instead of the regular \u2018http:\\\\\u2019)<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Other Resources that You Need <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. Disk Space \u2014 this is depends on how much media files are in your website.<\/p>\n<p>2. Bandwidth &amp; Traffic \u2014 depends on how much traffic comes to your website. If you receive more visitors and hits, you have to increase your bandwidth.<br \/>\n3. Professional Mail IDs \u2014 this depends on how many employees need this kind of technical email within your organization.<\/p>\n<p>4. Unlimited Plans \u2014 some hosting providers offer free space, bandwidth, storage for a certain period. You have to check with them whether they are truly unlimited.<\/p>\n<p>5. Payment \u2014 another significant aspect is cost efficiency. Find out if there are any hidden charges for renewals and improvements.<\/p>\n<p>6.
