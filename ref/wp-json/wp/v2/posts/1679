Recent studies have supported the idea that for the right people, working from home can increase productivity and decrease stress. Researches also suggest companies to encourage and support a work-from-home protocol that can actually save money in the long run and an added bonus on the employer side.<\/p>\n<p>Technically the location of the employee is no longer important, as long as they have a reliable internet connection and efficiency in workflow. With video chats, conference calls, VPN networks, and wireless Internet adapted from modern technology, they can constantly stay connected even though sitting at home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employer Benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Employees aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from working from home, a company can also benefit just as greatly from a remote employee. In addition to being an effective recruiting and retention tool, letting employees work from home can save employers money in myriad ways. This can reduce overhead expenditures, increase employee job satisfaction and reduce turnover, increase productivity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employee Benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Employees working at home have greater autonomy, face fewer interruptions and can focus on their work. Flex-time scheduling benefits employers and gives them a more effective work-life balance. They can also achieve cost savings, time to spend with family, job satisfaction, and Lifestyle flexibility. Usually going back to work after holidays feels a little lazy, but working from home feels like free as usual.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deadly Drawbacks of Working from Home<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The main drawbacks of working from home are:<\/p>\n<p>1) While interacting with team mates only through chat or video call is hard to develop and keep a fair bond between them.<\/p>\n<p>2) If the employer and the client are not comfortably conversing, it may badly affect the work.<\/p>\n<p>3) Not all kinds of jobs can be accessed as work from home; some require day to day interactions and discussions.<\/p>\n<p>4) It may be harder to monitor how employee&#8217;s work, or their deliverables.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Future of Work from Home<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The location will no longer be a limitation in the future era. Flexible office spaces such as Liquid Space are solving the location problem efficiently. Over the last couple of years, not only employees but also employers also accepted working from home culture. Currently, full-time employees are working from home at least once a week and the idea appealing to many. This number will only go up in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working from home can actually benefit both employers as well as employees.
