										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how recently you updated your website, it may soon be time to for a rebuild. If you&#8217;re one of the 75 million websites that use the WordPress platform, a huge update to the platform is coming that will require some site updates, if not many. The upcoming launch of WordPress 5.0 will be an opportunity for business owners to give their sites updates that enhance their performance and to improve their digital marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The release date for WordPress 5.0 is quickly approaching. If you ignored all the other updates this year, now’s the time to buckle down and take notice as this will be the biggest update for 2018 (possibly 2019). WordPress is completely revamping how users and developers use the CMS with their new Gutenberg editor. It’s now all about blocks.</p>
<p>WordPress 5.0 is different. Rather than adding minor improvements here and there, this release is entirely focused on the following two things:</p>
<p>1. The new Gutenberg WordPress Editor<br />
2. Twenty Nineteen WordPress theme</p>
<p>Other than that, minor changes and bug fixes are only being looked at on a case-by-case basis. In reality, it’s all about Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Even though WordPress 5.0 isn’t out yet, it’s essentially made up of the Gutenberg plugin which you can install right now and start testing.</p>
<p>Website owners will need to switch to the latest build of WordPress as soon as possible, since it will be the version that will gets updated and future plugins will require the latest version of WordPress. App developers will also need to make sure that their plugins are compatible with the new 5.0 architecture.</p>
<p>Be sure to update your current site to 4.9.8 and give the Gutenberg editor a try by downloading the plugin. More information about WordPress 5.0 will be coming out in the future, but stay tuned for more articles about this major change for many websites.</p>

<p>Store owners may hire people that help them with online shop management. Each of managers is responsible for this or that task respectively. This video shows how to configure multilevel user access and keep employees under control.</p>
<p>We have several employees and want to set permissions to them. See how it is done with Store Manager for Magento.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the padlock icon on the application top menu.</li>
<li>Select Users and Permissions option from the drop-down and confirm the action in dialog window. There will appear the window with Users and Roles tabs. Switch between them to access users and roles correspondingly.</li>
<li>Create the role and assign permissions to it. You can see the list of all available in Store Manager sections. Check boxes for ones to be viewed/modified by the user, role will be assigned to. We have added &#8220;Content Manager&#8221; role</li>
<li>Add user and assign just created role to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8220;Test&#8221; user with &#8220;Content Manager&#8221; role has been created and now we can check how it works. We are logging in the application with the user we have just configured and can see that some sections are greyed and we can&#8217;t view data or perform operations, disposed under these sections.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we know, Magento is very powerful template system. The same thing we can say about the logic part. Magento generally consists of about 50 modules. There are module to checkout, customer management, CMS sites, etc. module consists of a few parts in addition to design parts of it are: components, blocks, models and helpers. Component contains all the actions that happen when the module is used. If we <code>https://www.my-eshop.tld/index.php/a/b/c</code> url</p>
<p>It means that module must perform an action in C Controller b.<br />
I have been using these products to treath erectile dysfunction for a few months now, and Iam very happy to say that my symptoms have disappeared completely. Order levitra Canada? We are here to save you money on the very best prescription medication in the world.</p>
<p>To keep my erection healthy this are the ticket. Order cialis Canada! Each and every of the products available through our website has been produced using the best base materials.</p>
<p>The blocks are responsible for the preparation of data for templates. Each template can be used, it must have to block. Sometimes blocks are simple, they can sometimes complicated. At least in some situations it is useful to move data from the controller, the block, we do not have to charge it several times in a query.</p>
<p>For that we use the opportunity that gives us Magento , The storage of data.</p>
<p>In our controller we store data in variable called $ data, we can save on it, as this register:</p>
<pre>Mage:: register  ('MyData', $ dat);</pre>
<p>Then, in block file, you can use all that data again.</p>
<pre>$ Data =  Mage:: registry ('MyData');</pre>
<p>It is a little feature that can be very useful sometimes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Development mistakes</strong></p>
<p>1. <em>HTTP/HTTPS</em>, be carefully when you are developing an extension related to secured section. Always check secure mode and generate correct URL</p>
<p>2. Don&#8217;t copy/paste standard XML file from Internet, you will meet a number of random issues. For example, if your module don&#8217;t need admin router then don&#8217;t leave an admin router there, it will lead to some random issue for example auto redirect HTTP to HTTPS on your module.</p>
<p>3. Never get data from _GET or _POST, always get data from magento input data. If you don&#8217;t follow this rule, you will make ricks for the client site who using your extensions.</p>
<p>4. Always check module status and related component status before execute module block code (so when module is not activated, all module code are skipped completely)</p>
<p>5. New database table need to avoid name conflict with other extension by using prefix <em>ob_</em></p>
<p>6. New XML layout need to avoid name conflict with other extension by using prefix <em>ob_</em></p>
<p>7. Don&#8217;t use same router for front-end and admin (added Nov 2011)</p>
<p>8. <em>Non-object issue</em> : When you make a call to get an object , ALWAYS THINK if the result is doesn&#8217;t return an object in all case, then you need to check the result before making second call. Although this is a basic programming practice but in fact, Core Magento Code still have same mistake sometime. (added Dec 2012)</p>
<p>9. Use common CSS class/id name which may lead to layout compatible issues (added Dec 2012)</p>
<p>10. Lowercase and uppercase : For newbies and Window users, this become very popular. Window accept lowercase and uppercase function name as same but Linux understand them as different function</p>
<p>11. Templates folder should be named using prefix <em>ob_</em></p>
<p><strong>Deployment mistakes</strong><br />
1. Folder, files permission in some Server are built with high security protection and default permission is very low (no read permission even) so it would be a good practice to make sure that you set correct permission for files (normally set 755)</p>
<p>2. Disable Magento complier. In the case, you can&#8217;t access backend then check includes/config.php and comment all lines manually</p>
<p>3. Make sure you enable magento cache. To do this, go to Admin -&gt; System -&gt; Cache Management</p>
<p>This is also an importance step that some customers missed. If the cache is disabled then magento can start setting up during uploading the extension files. Some importance files might have not uploaded yet and causes the system do setting up in wrong way.</p>
<p>4. Logout and login the backend again. Some customers leave this step so they get access denied or 404 error page when accessing the extension configuration panel.</p>
<p>5. Make sure that you are using administration account with full permission.</p>
<p>6. Should check if there is any extension overwrote some related core block/model (added Nov 2011)</p>
<p>7. If the extension work on Window box but on Linux Server then the problem might be lowercase/uppercase.</p>
<p><strong>Good practice to follow</strong><br />
1. When need to include CSS depend on module. Use javascript to add CSS to head like this</p>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function ob_includeCss(cssFile)
{
var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
var css = document.createElement('link');
css.type = 'text/css';
css.rel = 'stylesheet';
css.href = cssFile;
head.appendChild (css);
}
ob_includeCss('http://www.myibsource.com/skin/frontend/default/default/joomlart/jmtabs/themes/methys/style.css');
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>2. Use local.xml to control layout for whole templates</p>
<p>3. CSS Layout/boxÂ  use Margin instead of Padding because IE have a bug in W3C Model box (padding will be laid inside element in IE!!!)</p>
<p>4. Use namespace company for all layout, templates and skin folder for your modules</p>
<p>5. <em>Try-catch in important code</em> : Sometime, you can&#8217;t predict all possible case/error so it is best to put a try/catch in important function/handler in production. Important features can be Observer functions, Front-end Block Class method, Model class methods</p>
<p>6. Create compilation.xml file with below code.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="heading h3"><span class="step">STEP 1. </span>Download the WordPress installation package</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi7-614x240-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="alignnone wp-image-199 size-full" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi7-614x240-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi7-614x240-1.jpg 614w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi7-614x240-300x117.jpg 300w" alt="wpi7-614x240" width="614" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>To start the installation process, first you need to download WordPress from itâ€™s O<a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fficial Download Page</a>. We recommend that you always download and install the latest stable version of WordPress.</p>
<p>Once you click on the <strong>Download</strong> button for the latest WordPress version, the installation package will be saved to your hard disk. Locate the installation package that youâ€™ve just downloaded and extract it to a new folder.</p>
<h3 class="heading h3"><span class="step">STEP 2. </span>Upload the WordPress Files to Your Server</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi8-470x240-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-full" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi8-470x240-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi8-470x240-1.jpg 470w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi8-470x240-300x153.jpg 300w" alt="wpi8-470x240" width="470" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you need to upload the extracted files and folders to your web server. The easiest way to upload the installation files is via FTP. Once the download is complete, extract the archive and upload it to your web hosting account. You can do that via FTP using a client application like Filezilla or via cPanel -&gt; File Manager -&gt; Upload file(s). If you want this WordPress installation to be main for your website, the files should reside in the public_html folder of your account. However, you can always make a subfolder (i.e. public_html/blog) if you want to run only part of your website on WordPress.</p>
<h3 class="heading h3"><span class="step">STEP 3. </span>Create a MySQL Database for WordPress to use</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi9-571x240-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi9-571x240-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi9-571x240-1.jpg 571w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi9-571x240-300x126.jpg 300w" alt="wpi9-571x240" width="571" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you need to create a MySQL database and assign a user to it with full permissions. Once you create your MySQL Database and User, make sure you write down the database name, database username and password youâ€™ve just created. You will need those for the installation process.</p>
<h3 class="heading h3"><span class="step">STEP 4. </span>Go through the installation process</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi1-607x240-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi1-607x240-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi1-607x240-1.jpg 607w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpi1-607x240-300x119.jpg 300w" alt="wpi1-607x240" width="607" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Now itâ€™s time to navigate to your website to start with the installation process. If you have uploaded WordPress in your public_html directory youâ€™ll need to go to <strong>http://yourdomain.com</strong> in your preferred browser. The first thing you will notice is a message, telling you that you donâ€™t have a wp-config.php file and you should create one. Just click on the Create a Configuration File button to proceed.</p>
<p>On this page you will see a message, asking you to prepare the necessary information for the installation. Since we already have this information, simply press the <strong>Go!</strong> button.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many tutorials how Magento set to work with several branches in different domains and save at any point. Since the release of Magento and Magento beta1 CE 1.4.0.0 1.6.0.0 EE to do it just yet.</p>
<h3>Magento evolves</h3>
<p>Solutions used in earlier versions require developers to change index.php file to show different areas to be treated in different stores. New index php contains the following code:</p>
<pre>$ MageRunCode = isset ($  _SERVER ['MAGE_RUN_CODE'])? $ _SERVER  ['MAGE_RUN_CODE']:'';
$ MageRunType = isset ($  _SERVER ['MAGE_RUN_TYPE'])? $ _SERVER  ['MAGE_RUN_TYPE']: 'Save';
Mage:: run ($  mageRunCode, mageRunType $);
</pre>
<p>Shall examine two environmental projects variables and use them to start runing Magento. What does it mean to you? You can now save for the website / run directly under the selected domain in the virtual host definition, or even to htaccess.</p>
<h3>VirtualHost solution</h3>
<p>To enjoy this little piece of code is enough to add the following lines to your VirtualHost definition:</p>
<pre>SetEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE base  "" # this is your site or store code
SetEnv MAGE_RUN_TYPE  "Website" # you set this website "or" store "

</pre>
<h3>.htaccess solution</h3>
<p>If you do not have access to virtual host definitions, you can still try to use. Htaccess for this by the following lines:</p>
<pre>SetEnvIf Host .* .*  yourhost MAGE_RUN_CODE = "base";
SetEnvIf Host .* .*  yourhost MAGE_RUN_TYPE = "Website";

Where yourhost .* .* is a regex expression matching the domain for which you want environment variable.</pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things in Magento, you can easily add new languages on its Web site. It is done all using CSV files, a file for a module for each language. For most major languages translations are available as free Magento Connect modules.</p>
<p>What if we want to change the translation and not lose changes, after upgrading Magento and translations? Or if we want to translate common regardless of module? Or just a list of all the texts that were taken from us, and are not original texts Magento? We can use our own very simple translation module.</p>
<p>You need to edit only two files:</p>
<p>* Etc / config.xml<br />
0.1.0 Baobaz_Translations_Helper Baobaz_Translations.csv<br />
class Baobaz_Translations_Helper_Data extends Mage_Core_Helper_Abstract { }</p>
<p>and that&#8217;s it. Module must be switched on (in etc / modules) and it will work.</p>
<p>in app / locale / fr_FR / file we create Baobaz_Translations.csv and in him we have all the new translations that we need.</p>
<p>Then, somewhere in Magento, whether it use templates, block or controller, we can:</p>
<p>echo Mage::helper(&#8216;translations&#8217;)-&gt;__(&#8216;text to translate&#8217;);</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a quick tip to sort/order latest product by both created date and new from date.</p>
<p><strong>Created At date</strong> is automatically added when you add a new product. However, you have to set <strong>New from Date</strong> manually while adding or editing product.</p>
<p>You may have product with same <strong>new from date</strong>.</p>
<p>And, then you need <strong>created at</strong> date to sort the latest product.</p>
<p>Here is the code to sort/order product by both created date and new from date:</p>
<pre>$todayDate = Mage::app()-&gt;getLocale()-&gt;date()-&gt;toString(Varien_Date::DATETIME_INTERNAL_FORMAT);
$collection = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')
 -&gt;getCollection()
 -&gt;addAttributeToFilter('news_from_date', array('date' =&gt; true, 'to' =&gt; $todayDate))
 -&gt;addAttributeToFilter('news_to_date', array('or'=&gt; array(
 0 =&gt; array('date' =&gt; true, 'from' =&gt; $todayDate),
 1 =&gt; array('is' =&gt; new Zend_Db_Expr('null')))
 ), 'left')
 -&gt;addAttributeToSort('news_from_date', 'desc')
 -&gt;addAttributeToSort('created_at', 'desc');</pre>
<p>Hope this code will help you. Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we will find out a solution troubleshooting Internal Server Error with Magento Store in any case for any reason. Some people may have this problem with their fresh Magento Installation or a Custom Magento Store or even it was running fine for a long time and suddenly you meet this issue. Sometime, this error is not visible and it just affect and make some Magento feature not working, for example this error just can be seen with <strong>Web Developer by tracking Ajax request and response</strong>. So here are a few possible reason</p>
<p><strong>Htaccess</strong> file which is located at Magento root folder. It will be this case if you meet Internal Server Error on every page. Try to remove it for testing purpose<br />
If your website was running file for a long time, then it must be a change at Server side, just submit a ticket to Hosting Company. The reason might be default permission on some hosting. Some hosting doesn&#8217;t allow high permission on folder, some need to grant correct permission on running script. For most cases I meet, you need to set permission 755 for index.php at Magento root</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Exception. Okay if you are not technical person, then there is no much thing you can do. Here are some ways you can try before need support from <strong>Magento experts</strong></li>
<li>Download <strong>magento-check.php</strong> script in order to validate basic requirement of your hosting.</li>
<li>Run <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/_media/groups/227/magento-cleanup2.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">magento-clean tool</a> to see if it solve your problem</li>
<li>Custom code/module conflict. OK, so if you have tried all way above and they don&#8217;t help. You may want to play around it. Here is my advise</li>
<li>Turn on Developer Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look in the Magento bootstrap file (<strong>index.php</strong>) you will see lines similar to the following</p>
<pre>#Mage::setIsDeveloperMode(true);
#ini_set('display_errors', 1);</pre>
<p>Uncomment these. In a production system, you&#8217;d never want to have your errors display to the browser, but while developing having an errors and warnings thrown immediately in your face is invaluable.</p>
<p>This way, you will see the actually problem which lead to the Internal Error Server. In almost cases, the reason is that there is an exception throw after output is sent to browser.</p>
<p>If you are looking at this post, I guess you are building a Magento Store then never forget to use <a href="http://store.onlinebizsoft.com/facebook-store-pro.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook Store Pro Magento Extension</a> for your store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This step-by-step tutorial will help you install Magento quickly and easily on localhost. When you install XAMPP â€“ make sure to install â€œphpmyadminâ€. Once you have XAMPP installed and running, follow these steps:</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Download Magento CE from here (recommended .zip file for Windows) <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/products/downloads/magento/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.magentocommerce.com/products/downloads/magento/</a></li>
<li>Extract contents of magento-1.9.1.0.zip into this folder: <strong>c:xampphtdocs</strong></li>
<li>As a result you should have a new folder called â€œmagentoâ€: <strong>c:xampphtdocsmagento</strong></li>
<li>Now open this URL in your browser: <a href="http://ewokesoft.com/2015/06/17/how-to-install-magento-on-localhost-like-xampp/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://localhost/magento/</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>You should see Magento installation page:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-397x240-1.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-221 size-full" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-397x240-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-397x240-1.png 397w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1-397x240-300x181.png 300w" alt="1-397x240" width="397" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Agree with terms and click â€œContinueâ€</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>On â€œLocalizationâ€ page select preferred options and click â€œContinueâ€</li>
<li>On â€œDatabase Connectionâ€ page you must specify credentials to an existing database. You have to create it manually. This can be done from phpmyadmin (which should be installed along with XAMPP)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Keep the tab in your browser with Magento installation open. Open a new tab and enter this URL: <a href="http://ewokesoft.com/2015/06/17/how-to-install-magento-on-localhost-like-xampp/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://localhost/phpmyadmin/</a></p>
<p>You should see phpmyadmin dashboard. In the top menu click â€œDatabasesâ€, then type some database name (say magentodb) and click â€œCreateâ€</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.png 600w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2-300x82.png 300w" alt="2" width="600" height="163" /></a></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Return to Magento installation tab. Enter the newly created database name, username â€œrootâ€ into database user field and Iâ€™d recommend you to enable â€œUse Web Server (Apache) Rewritesâ€ checkbox. You may leave all other fields as they are and click â€œContinueâ€.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just an interesting note: The charts that you see on the dashboard in the Magento Admin area are powered by Google&#8217;s Chart API. You can look it up here: https://code.google.com/apis/chart/</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dashboard.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-227 size-full" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dashboard.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dashboard.jpg 550w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dashboard-300x147.jpg 300w" alt="dashboard" width="550" height="269" /></a></p>
<p>A quick and prelim. exploration of the core files show that the phtml files for this can be found here:</p>
<pre>app/design/adminhtml/default/defaut/template/dashboard</pre>
<p>The controlling code is here:</p>
<pre>app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Dashboard</pre>
<p>Of particular interest is the class Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Dashboard_Graph<br />
There&#8217;s also some good code to be found there that you might find useful for your own use in the site, even if its not involving using Google API to create a chart. The controllers for this are interesting because they have some examples for ajax functionality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to understand how a module works we need to find out how basic components like controller, model, block and view interact with each other. If you have already worked with Magento before you should know why we need these structural units and how the module structure was organized in previous Magento versions.<span id="more-7661"></span></p>
<p>It all looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mudule_structure.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-233" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mudule_structure.png" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mudule_structure.png 466w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mudule_structure-300x266.png 300w" alt="mudule_structure" width="466" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we can see from this picture the module code was scattered across different directories (code, design, skin, etc).</p>
<p>A module in Magento 2 is located in a single directory which simplifies the search and analysis of the extension&#8217;s logic. Now the standard module structure looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/module_structure1.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-234" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/module_structure1.png" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/module_structure1.png 447w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/module_structure1-300x238.png 300w" alt="module_structure1" width="447" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s describe this structure. Once again all extensions are located in the app / code /. Then the following logic works:</p>
<p><strong>• Example</strong>: it is a vendor&#8217;s name (as a rule it coincides with the company name and should be unique).</p>
<p><strong>• Extension: </strong>module (extension) name.</p>
<p>The module includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>• Block: </strong>stores files that will ensure the interaction of the patterns (phtml from the View directory) with extension models or the whole system (optional directory).</p>
<p><strong>• Controller</strong>Â: these files are responsible for the connection of the module with the outside worldÂ  i.e. switching on the module by clicking on an url. (Example site.com/extension/index/indexÂ  lead to the module controller. (optional directory).</p>
<p><strong>• etc</strong> contains the configuration files.</p>
<p><strong>• Helper:</strong> contains the files that are responsible for performing general tasks for extension objects and variables.</p>
<p><strong>• Model: </strong>contains the files that are responsible for connection with the database (optional directory).</p>
<p><strong>• Setup</strong>: includes the files that are necessary to make changes in the databaseÂ  i.e. creating tables, fields, or other records required for the module performance (optional directory).</p>
<p><strong>• Test:</strong> contains the files that are necessary to perform the module test. (optional directory).</p>
<p><strong>• View</strong>:Â  includes the files that are necessary for information output on the frontend and backend. Commonly these files contain html code (optional directory).</p>
<p>Understanding the module structure in Magento 2 allows analysis of the extension&#8217;s logic and performance as well as an easier job finding and fixing arising errors and conflicts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s fun to have your own personal web blogs. Blogs are web logs. You have the ability to make them your own personal web space. A place to invite friends, share photos, experiences, write your own personal thoughts and a host of other creative things to do! Some folks would like to have a web blog site, but think that it&#8217;s too hard to create. Well with WordPress it&#8217;s as simple as 1-2-3! They make it very easy and fun to create your own web blog.</p>
<h2>How to Set Up a WordPress Blog</h2>
<p>1. Got to the WordPress website. (See resource below.) Click the &#8220;sign up now&#8221; button.</p>
<p>2. Pick a user name and password of your choice. Then you will need to confirm your password. You must insert your email address for them to contact you. Agree to their web blog terms and hit next. Your user name will be the beginning of your website address.</p>
<p>3. The website will send you an email confirmation. Once you click to confirm, it will bring up the link to start your website. You will then be linked to a dashboard where you can begin to set up your web pages.</p>
<p>4. One of the first things you will need to do is to choose a design theme for your web pages. It&#8217;s quite simple. All you have to do is scan through each theme and choose one that you like. It will automatically bring up the background for you. Some design themes will give you the option to change some of the pictures in the theme.</p>
<p>5. When a design has been chosen, set up your front welcome page. You just need to go to write, and then choose pages. A feed will come up for you to write your thoughts.</p>
<p>6. You have many other options to create your pages. There is an option to choose different widgets to enhance your web pages. A widget looks like a small icon. They have a small embedded code that links you to another page, website or photo. Some widgets link you to weather websites, web photo albums like Facebook, or another blogging site like MySpace. They can work on any web page, such as a blog or social networking page. You can also add subtitles, pictures, additional web page links, to your current websites.</p>
<p>7. Within each web blog there are page and post set ups. You will need to click on create a page first and it will give an opportunity to name the page and share a little bit about what the page is all about. You can return to those pages and edit at any time, by clicking on the manage pages.</p>
<p>8. There is also a section where you can add posts. Posts just consists of information that you want to include on your web pages, like fun facts about yourself, friends or family, places you have lived, traveled and even special events like graduations. The posts you create can be linked to the pages you create, through widgets. Widgets can also give you an option to feed your posts to other existing blogs that have been created. This gives the web community an opportunity to view your posts and comment on them. You do have the option of keeping your posts private if you so desire.</p>
<p>9. WordPress is very easy to use. It has a self-help guide for those who get stuck. Most of the time, it will walk you through each step. WordPress also gives you the opportunity to set up more than one web blog. So your opportunities are endless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing Your Magento Store is a course that is helpful to anyone involved in the planning, orchestration, and day-to-day management of Magento Enterprise Edition. You don&#8217;t have to have a technical background to utilize many of the features in Enterprise Edition, but it&#8217;s good to learn how to use them from Magento experts. Knowing what is available out-of-the-box in Magento Enterprise Edition&#8217;s administration panel can help non-programmers such as marketers and merchandisers manage this type of functionality instead of programming and development teams.</p>
<p>Here are three of the most popular things we cover in Managing Your Magento Store:</p>
<h3>1. Product and Catalog Strategy</h3>
<p>Class participants get the opportunity to think about their own products and catalog and critical factors for planning how products will be implemented, including how to set up cookie cutter style Product Attribute sets to make management easier and provide more flexibility in the output.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/new_product_cameras-644x362-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-266" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/new_product_cameras-644x362-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/new_product_cameras-644x362-1.jpg 644w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/new_product_cameras-644x362-300x169.jpg 300w" alt="new_product_cameras 644x362" width="644" height="362" /></a><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/camera_attributes-644x362-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-269" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/camera_attributes-644x362-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/camera_attributes-644x362-1.jpg 644w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/camera_attributes-644x362-300x169.jpg 300w" alt="camera_attributes 644x362" width="644" height="362" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Customer Segments and Promotions</h3>
<p>As we walk through the exercises, participants set up customer segments and learn how customers can automatically be placed into those segments based on criteria. We take this a step further and learn how those customers can receive promotions, such as special prices, or see special merchandise based on their membership in a segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/female_subscribers-644x362-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-268" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/female_subscribers-644x362-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/female_subscribers-644x362-1.jpg 644w, http://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/female_subscribers-644x362-300x169.jpg 300w" alt="female_subscribers 644x362" width="644" height="362" /></a> <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shopping-cart-rule-female-high-spenders-644x362-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267" src="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shopping-cart-rule-female-high-spenders-644x362-1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" srcset="https://www.ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shopping-cart-rule-female-high-spenders-644x362-1.jpg 644w, https://ewokesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shopping-cart-rule-female-high-spenders-644x362-300x169.jpg 300w" alt="shopping cart rule female high spenders 644x362" width="644" height="362" /></a></p>
<h3>3. Special Pricing Display</h3>
<p>One of my favorite features of the course is that we deeply explore the point-and-click configuration of the Enterprise Edition administration panel. In doing so, we review configuration techniques that can help you to avoid costly development by knowing what Magento Enterprise Edition already does without custom programming. One example of this would be in setting up a way to hide prices unless customers are logged in.</p>
