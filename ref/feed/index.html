										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In essence, an Instagram shadow ban refers to the platform&#8217;s restriction of your content&#8217;s visibility. Your material with hash tags not showing up on Explore pages for anyone but your followers is the main indicator of a shadow ban. Another consequence is that your audience and visibility for posts are severely constrained. Shadow banning is a word that was inspired by a comparable Twitter activity. Although not an official term, it is a well-liked one among social media users.</p>
<p><strong>                 How to Determine Whether You&#8217;ve Been Shadow banned</strong></p>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t obvious, Instagram&#8217;s shadow ban procedures make it challenging to determine whether you have been punished. Although there is no foolproof technique to determine if you have been shadow banned, the following tests should give you a good indication:</p>
<p><strong>Check your postings</strong></p>
<p>Send a fresh live post together with a well-known hashtag. Ask a few individuals who do not follow you to look at the stuff under the hashtag to see if your post appears.</p>
<p><strong>Check your hashtags</strong></p>
<p>Instagram has recognized that some contentious hashtags have been hidden, among other things. You might have used one of these hashtags if you discover a message concealed behind one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Review your Instagram insights data</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good possibility you&#8217;ve been shadow banned if your impressions and engagement outside of your follower base have suddenly dropped dramatically.</p>
<p>Instagram shadow banning, also known as ghost banning, is a practice where a user&#8217;s content on Instagram is blocked or partially hidden from a wider audience without their knowledge. The affected user may still see their posts and interact with their followers, but their posts may not appear in hashtags, search results, or the feeds of users who don&#8217;t already follow them.</p>
<p><strong>Some causes of shadow banning are listed below, along with remedies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using Prohibited Hashtags:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid utilizing hashtags that Instagram has restricted or banned. These hashtags are frequently linked to offensive or spammy material.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Instagram Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you are abiding by Instagram&#8217;s Community Guidelines, which prohibit employing automation, spamming, and engaging in any form of harassment or hate speech.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Pods or Bots:</strong></p>
<p>Use automation or engagement pods that artificially boost your engagement at all costs. These actions might be recognized as spam by Instagram&#8217;s algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Extraordinary Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Keep the number of likes, comments, and followers you leave on social media to a sensible minimum. Instagram&#8217;s spam filters may be activated by overly frequent engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication fraud:</strong></p>
<p>Be genuine and natural in your interactions with your fans. Accounts that engage in questionable or fake behavior may be punished by Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Content Violations:</strong></p>
<p>Make sure your content complies with Instagram&#8217;s rules to avoid content violations. Do not use offensive language, nudity, violence, or other forbidden materials.</p>
<p><strong>Report the Issue to Instagram: </strong></p>
<p>If you believe you were unjustly shadow banned, you can use the app to inform Instagram of the problem. To report a problem, go to Settings &gt; Help &gt; Report a Problem and explain the issue you&#8217;re having.</p>
<p><strong>Changing to a Business Profile: </strong></p>
<p>If you currently have a personal account, you might want to think about transferring to a business profile. You may be able to comprehend and expand your reach by using the additional insights and statistics that business profiles have access to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Instagram&#8217;s algorithm and rules may change over time, so staying informed about their guidelines and best practices is key to maintaining a healthy and visible presence on the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, think about contacting a trustworthy agency like ewoke, which is regarded as a top <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/services/social-media-marketing-advertising/">Social Media Marketing &amp; Advertising Agency in Kochi, Kerala, India,</a> if you need professional assistance with social media marketing and digital advertising.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever dreamt of effortlessly bringing to life an image from your imagination? Now, this is achievable in just a few minutes, courtesy of image generators such as Midjourney. Whether you&#8217;re not endowed with artistic talents or haven&#8217;t experienced the touch of a paintbrush, artificial intelligence takes charge of the intricate work. You only require a snippet of descriptive text outlining the envisioned image.</p>

<p><strong>How to Use Midjourney for Marketing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create eye-catching graphics for your blog posts, social media, and newsletters:</strong></p>
<p>A prevalent strategy for employing Midjourney in marketing involves crafting captivating graphics for blog posts, social media updates, and newsletters.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Optimizing your landing page is one of the most straightforward ways to increase your lead generation. The first page visitors see when they arrive at your website is your landing page. Visitors may simply leave your website if what they see is uninteresting. You should take landing page optimization seriously because of this. You can benefit from greater conversion rates if your landing page is thoughtfully developed. You can improve your landing pages in the following ways to produce more leads:</p>
<p>Your offer should be the main emphasis of everything on your landing page. Your product line or company history should not be discussed here. Focus only on what the visitor will receive after performing the required step, whether you&#8217;re selling a downloaded item or a trial. To encourage a speedy response from your reader, stick to just one option, such as a download or a trial.</p>
<p>Readers can become interested in your goods through well-written content. At the same time, it can also let readers know what benefits you can offer them.  Create your content so that your voice and tone of speech are engaging to them. Although it need not be lengthy, your material must be engaging.</p>
<p>Your headline is one of the first elements visitors will see on your landing page. A compelling title can captivate readers and pique their interest in your merchandise. A poorly written one, however, can cause consumers to leave your website. Subheadings play a significant role in your on-page content. They may be used to divide your information into more manageable sections. Your content&#8217;s readability may be improved by breaking it up into smaller sections. Additionally, it improves the organization of your landing page.</p>
<p>Use call-to-action buttons to encourage visitors to join up for your service. They can also encourage the reader to provide their contact information. Your CTA button&#8217;s placement is just as important as its actual existence. It can increase your revenue and drive more purchases if you&#8217;ve put it in a visible yet inconspicuous location.</p>
<p>An action is what you want a visitor to do after you&#8217;ve got their attention. You must offer them forms so they can fill out their information for this. However, adding a form to your landing page is not sufficient. For a better user experience, you must optimize it.First, check to be that the form is prominently displayed on your landing page. Make sure your form isn&#8217;t too lengthy next. Remove a couple fields that aren&#8217;t really important, if necessary. Additionally, users may become impatient with your form if it is too lengthy, and they may decide to leave rather than convert.</p>
<p>You must examine each component on your landing page if you want to increase the speed at which your page loads. Your loading speed can vary greatly depending on the theme, the size of the photos, and any embedded media. They slow down the loading of your pages if they are not properly optimized.</p>
<p>You may increase your conversion rate by using landing pages. A landing page and a regular page or post differ primarily in that they serve a distinct purpose. Once you get visitors on your landing pages, remove all obstacles and make it very simple for them to move on to the next step.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every single day, a brand-new marketing trend emerges. While some of these trends may be transitory trends others may fundamentally alter the competition for your business.</p>
<p>Modern consumers seek a higher degree of personalization i.e. products, connections, and marketing tactics that are carefully tailored to their individual interests.</p>
<p>Personalized service has therefore swiftly become the new norm, forcing marketers to go on to hyper-personalization as the next stage.</p>
<p>Based on each user&#8217;s unique wants and interests, hyper personalization creates highly customized experiences for them. This can be accomplished through specialized interfaces, personalized recommendations with graphics and videos, and targeted material. Businesses may provide clients highly personalized experiences by utilizing data, AI, analytics, automation, and contextualized communications that are sent at the ideal time and through the most effective channel. As a result, businesses may send clients emails that are directly related to their unique behaviors and interests.</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-personalization is a crucial component of e-commerce for a number of reasons.</strong></p>
<p>&gt; Customers are so delighted by personalized buying opportunities that they virtually always decide on a company that creates material exclusively for them. Brands may demonstrate to clients that they understand and care about their specific needs and goals by giving hyper-personalized options.</p>
<p>&gt; Brands can foresee what people will desire before they can make their own preferences. Spending on impulse is encouraged as a result, of increasing revenue and sales.</p>
<p>&gt; Customers can focus on things they genuinely care about when brands quit spending their time on things they don&#8217;t want to sell to them. inevitably, businesses using sophisticated personalization—particularly real-time personalization—can anticipate higher returns.</p>
<p>Retailers should focus hyper personalization in the following aspects of their customer journey in order to improve the shopper experience:</p>
<p>&gt; By offering a personalized homepage, prompts and pop-ups, personalized product rankings, and a chat-bot with personalized services, marketers can hyper-personalize their websites.</p>
<p>&gt; Email personalization is similar to website customization in that it involves tracking a user&#8217;s interactions with your emails and using that information to send them subsequent emails that are more targeted and relevant.</p>
<p>&gt; Brands can offer all customers access to upscale styling services through promotional campaigns. A customer&#8217;s top product interests, the season, and offers that are likely to be relevant to them particularly are all aspects that AI can use to hyper-personalize suggestions.</p>
<p>&gt; Use of social networking sites like Facebook and messaging services like WhatsApp is booming. AI chatbots are able to do more than just respond to client questions and handle exchanges and refunds. They can also alert customers when things are back in stock, make tailored product recommendations, and provide styling tips.</p>
<p>&gt; Brands can better understand each client that shops with them so they can customize their recommendations and rewards.</p>
<p>You can use hyper-personalization to your advantage to develop marketing efforts that are more pertinent and interesting.</p>
<p>You may deliver material that appears to be specially crafted for your customer by being aware of their individual wants and preferences.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is AI and How Does it Impact Digital Marketing Strategies?</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) pertains to the capacity of machines to carry out activities that traditionally necessitate human intelligence, such as acquiring knowledge, finding solutions to problems, and making decisions. In the context of digital marketing strategies, AI can be used to analyze data, personalize messaging, and optimize campaigns. It can also help businesses automate repetitive tasks and improve customer experiences. The impact of AI on digital marketing strategies is significant, as it can lead to more efficient and effective marketing efforts, increased ROI, and improved customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Major Disadvantages of Using AI in Digital Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the world of digital marketing in recent years. With its ability to analyze large amounts of data, automate tasks, and personalize experiences, AI has become an indispensable tool for marketers. However, as useful as AI can be, it also has some significant disadvantages that need to be considered before implementing it in your digital marketing strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Emotional Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>One of the primary disadvantages of using AI in digital marketing is its lack of emotional intelligence. AI is an algorithm-based system that cannot understand human emotions or reactions. Therefore, it may fail to recognize the emotional context of a situation that could have a significant impact on a customer&#8217;s decision-making process. This can lead to AI-driven marketing campaigns falling flat or even backfiring.</p>
<p><strong>Dependence on Data</strong></p>
<p>AI is data-driven, which means it relies on large amounts of data to make decisions and predictions. However, data is not always accurate, and AI can only work with the data it has been trained on. This can result in biased or incomplete insights, leading to incorrect conclusions and ineffective marketing strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Creativity</strong></p>
<p>While AI can automate many tasks and optimize processes, it has limited creativity. AI is only as creative as the data it has been trained on, and it cannot come up with entirely new ideas or strategies on its own. Creative marketing requires human intuition, imagination, and experience, which AI lacks.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Personalization</strong></p>
<p>AI is excellent at personalization, but it can also fall short in some areas. For example, AI may not be able to understand the nuances of a customer&#8217;s preferences or interests, leading to irrelevant or even inappropriate recommendations. Additionally, some customers may feel uncomfortable with the level of personalization that AI can offer, leading to a lack of trust in the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Cost and Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Implementing AI in digital marketing can be costly and complex. Companies need to invest in the necessary technology and infrastructure, as well as hire skilled professionals to manage and interpret the data. Additionally, AI systems require ongoing maintenance and updates to remain effective, which can add to the overall cost.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Concerns</strong></p>
<p>AI raises ethical concerns in digital marketing, particularly when it comes to data privacy and security. Companies must ensure that customer data is collected and used ethically and legally, with proper consent and transparency. Additionally, AI-driven marketing can reinforce existing biases and stereotypes, leading to discrimination and exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>How to Mitigate the Risks Associated with Implementing AI in Digital Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Here are some ways to mitigate the risks associated with implementing AI in digital marketing:</p>
<p>&gt; Start small and test regularly to identify potential issues early on.</p>
<p>&gt; Focus on transparency and privacy to build trust with customers and avoid legal issues.</p>
<p>&gt; Use high-quality data and ensure it is properly labelled and structured to avoid bias and inaccuracies.</p>
<p>&gt; Train and educate your team to effectively use and understand AI tools and results.</p>
<p>&gt; Have a plan in place for handling errors or unexpected results.</p>
<p>&gt; Continuously monitor and update your AI models to ensure they are performing effectively and ethically.</p>
<p><strong>The Pros &amp; Cons Of Leveraging AI For Your Digital Marketing Efforts</strong></p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>&gt; AI can help automate routine tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>&gt; AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly, providing valuable insights for marketing strategies.</p>
<p>&gt; AI can personalize marketing efforts based on individual customer preferences and behaviours.</p>
<p>&gt; AI can improve targeting and segmentation, increasing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>&gt; AI can enhance the customer experience by providing personalized recommendations and support.</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>&gt; AI may not always provide accurate predictions or insights, leading to flawed decision-making.</p>
<p>&gt; AI can be expensive to implement and maintain, especially for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>&gt; AI may not fully understand the nuances of human behaviour and may not be able to replicate human creativity.</p>
<p>&gt; AI may raise ethical concerns around data privacy and the potential misuse of customer information.</p>
<p>&gt; AI may not be able to fully replace human interactions and relationships with customers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while AI has many benefits for digital marketing, it also has significant disadvantages that need to be considered. Companies must weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully before implementing AI in their marketing strategies. They must also ensure that ethical and legal considerations are taken into account to avoid negative consequences for both customers and the brand.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Artificial Intelligence transforming the Digital Marketing Industry? If your answer is “YES” then you need to clearly understand what AI is, and what are the benefits and limitations of Chatbots, and expectations Vs reality. First of all AI marketing is a cutting-edge approach that makes use of intelligence technologies to gather data, get customer insights, forecast customers&#8217; next moves, and make automated decisions. One of the best methods to transform the business sector is through AI marketing. Firms need artificial intelligence (AI) because it helps both big and small firms succeed, ensures effective decision-making, and revolutionizes management.</p>
<p>Does this imply that a Chatbot is a more effective salesperson than a human being?</p>
<p>Absolutely Not. Buy you might think about how AI brings down the digital marketing costs. AI helps to reduce digital marketing costs in some ways like Chatbots offer automated customer interaction service, automate recruiting and hiring- while selecting CVs, improve communication efficiency, building customer relationship. But each and everything has its own limitations, nothing can replace a human brain and talent.</p>
<p>The facts are:</p>
<p><strong>The quality of an AI tool&#8217;s output depends on the quality of its input data </strong></p>
<p>Businesses are developing an AI-driven marketing automation strategy and utilizing already-existing solutions that are AI-powered to get better ROI. To support marketers and advertisers, AI tool implementation alone is insufficient. Applications and tools for artificial intelligence (AI) are built on algorithms; however the AI can only produce outcomes based on the inputs that are provided to it.</p>
<p><strong>AI cannot be utilized to replace human marketers; it can only be used to help them.</strong></p>
<p>It is impossible to allocate significant funds to the implementation of AI technologies with the hope that they would handle all of your marketing duties. Even if you successfully build an AI tool, you still need to examine and tweak the algorithm from time to time. Making certain that procedures are efficient and meet your needs.</p>
<p>So you can’t replace a professional digital marketing team with AI. AI marketing can&#8217;t completely replace humans in the field of digital marketing. Yes, specific activities will be replaced by AI marketing, but not essential human responsibilities in digital marketing. Even with the use of AI in marketing, the field of digital marketing still depends on human intelligence because, at least for now, human qualities like empathy, compassion, and storytelling cannot yet be replicated by machines.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the combination of AI and human talent will help you build your business in a great way. As AI need to be monitored to make sure it work in a proper manner or not, and need to check the quality, so human + machines make a great impact in digital marketing. Digital marketing always helps brands reach their target audience and promote their product or service. eWoke As the <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/services/">Best Digital Marketing Agency in Kochi, Kerala</a> connect our team of experts to learn more about how we can help you to reach your business and marketing goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bard is Google&#8217;s answer to ChatGPT. Google&#8217;s new AI is the product of intense pressure on the search giant to produce an AI that is equivalent to OpenAI&#8217;s popular ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The tech world has been buzzing about the impressive capabilities and performance of AI-powered search engines like Microsoft Bing and Google Bard. Both search engines are revolutionizing the way people search for information online. Google has now launched its own experimental AI, Bard, powered by the search engine stalwart&#8217;s LaMDA technology. The move comes as the war to dominate the new technological frontier intensifies, with Microsoft announcing its $10bn investment into ChatGPT&#8217;s parent company OpenAI. Tech giants are already rushing to beat one another to the top of the AI mountain, with no signs of slowing.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is LaMDA?</em></strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, Google unveiled their Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA). LaMDA is built on Transformer, a neural network architecture that Google Research invented in 2017, and incorporates multimodal user intent, reinforcement learning, and suggestions. It is a statistical method that predicts future words based on previous ones, allowing the chatbot to stimulate conversation in a flowing manner.</p>
<p>LaMDA uses less computing power, allows for scalability, and provides a more effective feedback system. Google trained LaMDA on actual dialogue so that it could interact with people in a natural way rather than just fetching numerous results for queries in the way a search engine works. The real breakthrough, according to the company, is its ability to hold a free-flowing conversation compared with other chatbots that provide predetermined responses.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is Google Bard?</em></strong></p>
<p>Google Bard is an artificial intelligence-powered conversational chatbot that uses Google&#8217;s LaMDA technology. This could compete with Chat GPT, a popular chatbot developed by OpenAI and supported by Microsoft. The service will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to generate responses to user-inputted queries and commands that will imitate human speech.</p>
<p>Google Bard was initially only available to a small group of beta testers. However, plans are in work to make it more accessible in the near future.</p>
<p><strong><em>What influenced Google’s AI announcement?</em></strong></p>
<p>Google has launched its own AI chatbot service to compete with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, which has over 100 million users. This is exciting news for the AI community, as more people rely on these chatbots to assist them with tasks and answer their questions. Bard&#8217;s ability to explain complex topics in a way that even a kid can follow demonstrates the power of Google&#8217;s technology. It&#8217;s amazing to see how quickly the AI landscape is changing and how these two chatbots are already influencing how we access and consume information. Due to the popularity of chatbots &amp; its immense growth, Google is releasing a competitor.</p>
<p>The competition between these two tech industry giants will drive both companies to innovate and improve their respective chatbots, benefiting users in the end. Google&#8217;s top revenue strategy is based on being the number one search engine, so any competitor like ChatGPT is critical. The impact of ChatGPT cannot be neglected, with one million users in five days and 100 million in two months. Google will try to replicate this success with its AI model or risk losing its search influence.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s the difference between Bard and ChatGPT?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are some notable differences between ChatGPT and Bard. Lamda, Google&#8217;s language model, gathers information from the Internet to answer questions about recent events. ChatGPT, on the other hand, can only access data till 2021. This could help Bard when answering questions about recent events.</p>
<p>ChatGPT seems to have the advantage in terms of availability. This is free to use, however there is now a premium version of the service, ChatGPT Plus. Bard, on the other hand, is still limited for a restricted set of testers. That is expected to change soon.</p>
<p>Both tools have different backgrounds. Google, a billion-dollar tech company, is behind Bard, while OpenAI, a startup AI research business, is behind ChatGPT. But, OpenAI can now count on Microsoft&#8217;s support. The software company has put ten billion US dollars towards the operation.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what Google has planned for Bard. Is it going to be more effective than ChatGPT?</p>
<p>The arrival of Google&#8217;s AI chatbot marks a significant shift in the technology that tech brands will invest in over the next few years. Both Microsoft Bing and Google Bard are impressive AI-powered search engines that are making significant progress in their respective fields, with Bing being more user-friendly and Bard backed by Google&#8217;s vast data. The outcome of this competition will be decided by what users want and expect, as well as how both search engines develop and keep improving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why should I pay for ads if I can rank organically for free? This is a valid question that you may have found yourself asking. Are Google advertisements still worthwhile given their rising costs and intense competition?</p>
<p>Google Ads, one of the popular online advertising platforms, and the quickest approach to get visitors to your internet business. Marketers may use them to place bids on certain keywords, ensuring that their clickable advertisements show up in Google search results. We&#8217;ve compiled all the crucial details about Google Ads and determined whether or not they&#8217;re profitable. Thus, we think that reading this article will provide you with a wealth of knowledge that will aid in your ability to make an informed investment.</p>
<p><strong>Do Google Ads Pay Off?</strong></p>
<p>Google Ads is where you should put your time, money, and effort. Paying for the Google Ads advertisement is the first step. This is quite easy because you only get paid when customers click on your advertisements. This mimics website owners bidding against one another in the Google auction more closely. Additionally, a lot depends on what occurs after the visitor clicks the advertisement. It is profitable if visitors to your website end up becoming paying customers. Google Ads is not worth your time and money, though, if the conversion is not worth more than the price of your advertisement.</p>
<p>And also, consistency is the key!</p>
<p>You cannot decide to run advertisements for a month to see if they are worthwhile. Understanding Google in relation to your targeted service, market, etc. takes time. Keeping your keywords, ad copy, and landing pages consistent should raise your click-through and conversion rates while lowering your CPC.</p>
<p><strong>How Effective Are Google Ads?</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Google advertising is a little more intricate. It needs more than merely launching adverts in the hopes of receiving good results from Google. To do it right, you need to have a lot of strong experience, talent, and abilities. Knowing where things are headed in the near future should enable you to make the required adjustments in good time to stay ahead of the curve. Finding and working with <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">Google Ads Experts in Kochi, Kerala</a>, is therefore necessary to maximize the benefits of Google Ads.</p>
<p><strong>What Should You Budget for Google Ads?</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how much you should spend specifically on Google Ads, the appropriate reaction is that it depends. Since you&#8217;ll be using keywords, keep in mind that each one has a number of variables to take into account and a cost associated with it. The worth of the campaign you want to run will determine how much you need to spend on advertisements. It also depends how much you and your rivals estimate that a visitor&#8217;s click would be worth. Additionally, based on the business or specialization, website visitors, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How Much Time Does It Take for Google Ads to Start Working?</strong></p>
<p>You might be shocked to learn that an effective Google Ad campaign will take at least 90 days to develop, and another four to 12 months to blossom into a powerful campaign, if you&#8217;re asking how long it takes for Google Ads to work.</p>
<p>Briefly stated, Google needs this processing time in order to gather enough data and determine the most efficient approach to show your ad to the appropriate audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Ads function flawlessly. However, you can believe that it is not worth the money or work if you don&#8217;t know what needs to be done at the appropriate moment. Our team at eWoke is more than pleased to assist you with planning and setting up your ads if you are new to Google Ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know a single Google update has the power to change the entire picture of search results. Keeping up with Google&#8217;s updates and ranking criteria will help you not only have an efficient SEO strategy, but also provide visitors who interact with your website and content with better results for their search queries.</p>
<p>Google introduced a new technology in 2021 called MUM (Multitask Unified Model). The multimodal algorithm&#8217;s goal is to improve search results and overcome linguistic constraints. This algorithm can take complicated questions and give a concrete response without conducting numerous searches. By gaining access to information in various languages, images, videos, and audio, it does this.</p>
<p>The question of whether or when MUM would be a ranking element has received a lot of attention since the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>The MUM Update&#8217;s advantages</strong></p>
<p>&gt; To compare and learn more about the searched topic, MUM will eliminate the need to conduct numerous searches. Instead of having to conduct repeated searches, users will benefit from deeper understanding using MUM.</p>
<p>&gt; MUM eliminates linguistic barriers. It offers a more thorough search experience and can comprehend 75 different languages. It will leverage a user&#8217;s inquiries and compare its linguistic expertise to deliver more accurate information.</p>
<p>&gt; One straightforward result can be obtained if a user wants to compare something. Thus, there is no need to conduct numerous searches. Users will have access to a plethora of knowledge across many different topics as a result of being able to quickly respond to comparison inquiries.</p>
<p>&gt; Complex material becomes useful because to MUM&#8217;s usage of AI technology to improve machine learning; this should help those who prioritize user intent behind searches.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ready for MUM</strong></p>
<p>SEO specialists and experts in digital marketing must keep their websites optimized for Google in order to be ready for MUM. Now is the moment to incorporate multi-language SEO into your plan, if you haven&#8217;t already. Given that you will now be competing against contributions from all around the world, having relevant, user-friendly material is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Creating things entails more than just using keywords. It involves a combination of creating links (not simply backlinks), employing the appropriate markup, and using the right keywords (in moderation).</p>
<p>Creative content that focuses on search intent rather than keyword matching will be required. Instead of focusing on a single word or phrase, think of your content to catch a variety of closely connected questions and help users to find the solution.</p>
<p>The rising significance of podcasts, photos, audio, and video information is one modification that might be required. You retain your relevance in accordance with the MUM algorithm when you interact with your audience through text, photos, and other forms of media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Google penalty?</strong></p>
<p>A website that contains content that is in violation of the Google-enforced marketing standards is subject to a Google penalty.</p>
<p>Since December 2000, Google has continually updating its algorithm for ranking pages. Over the course of the subsequent 15 years, Google continued to improve the quality of its search results. With time, it begins to push high-quality content higher in the SERPs and completely eliminate low-quality content. In this case, penalties are applied.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Penguin update became accessible. It suddenly affected search results, entirely removed certain websites from search, eliminated low-quality content, and compelled optimizers to consider their content strategy much more carefully.</p>
<p><em>Any website could be vulnerable. Sincere and well-intentioned attempts to improve your site&#8217;s rating may result in a Google penalty. After getting a penalty, it is challenging to regain your great reputation and Google&#8217;s favor. Numerous businesses have been ruined by Google&#8217;s algorithm updates. Don&#8217;t become one of them. Be aware of the causes that Google typically mentions for penalties.</em></p>
<p><strong>Google penalizing your website: why?</strong></p>
<p>• Duplicate content<br />
• Spyware, adware, or viruses<br />
• Buying links<br />
• Keyword stuffing<br />
• Cloaking<br />
• Slow Site Loading<br />
• Broken External Links<br />
• Black Hat SEO Advice<br />
• Error Codes<br />
• Excessive Optimization</p>
<p><strong>How can a Google penalty be lifted?</strong></p>
<p>A manual sanction is a decision made explicitly by a Google employee. If you have received a manual penalty, a notification will appear here with the reason for the penalty, the action that was taken, and a link that will take you directly to the issue. You can see all the details in Google Search Console.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s algorithm will detect a flaw when crawling a website and penalise the page as necessary via an algorithmic penalty. Websites with poor or duplicate content, keyword-stuffed material, poor page loads, or a lack of inbound connections may be subject to algorithmic penalties like Panda, Penguin, and Hummingbird. You will still appear in search results with this kind of penalty, though possibly at a considerably lower position.</p>
<p>You must examine the backlinks to your website to determine which ones contributed to the decline in your rankings, whether it was due to a manual or algorithmic penalty. Once the links have been located, try to delete them, and disavow the ones you are unable to.</p>
<p>Your competition is increasing daily, and Google&#8217;s website ranking algorithm is always changing. When you suspect a Google penalty, you could actually require better search engine optimization techniques.</p>
<p>As the top <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">SEO company in Kochi, Kerala, India</a><strong>,</strong> eWoke, with many years fo expertise in different domains and frameworks, can ensure that your website dominates search engine results, that you receive the most quality traffic, that you are protected from a Google penalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Possessing your Facebook Ad account or page hacked is an anxiety-inducing scenario. Most often, hackers break into an ad account to display false advertisements. They run their ads using your credit card or another payment mechanism linked to your account.</p>
<p><strong>If your account has been compromised, take the following actions right away.</strong></p>
<p>→ Deactivate the unauthorized adverts that hackers have developed. Turning the suspicious adverts off will allow you some time to take the necessary actions to repair the situation associated with your compromised account.</p>
<p>→ Once you turn off the false advertising, they can easily be turned back on if the hackers already have access to your ads account. Click on your Ads Manager account&#8217;s activity history to view the activities of the hackers. You may see a history of all account changes performed between a specified period range.</p>
<p>→ Inform your payment providers regarding the unauthorized charges made to your account and request that block payments to Facebook until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>→ Contact Facebook to report the occurrence. Make sure to submit a report through Ads Payment Section once you&#8217;ve contacted the support team to explain what occurred to your account.</p>
<p><strong>How to Prevent Most of the Hacks</strong></p>
<p>Make some changes to your account&#8217;s settings and take a few precautions to prevent future hacks of your Facebook page or advertisements account.</p>
<p>• Establish two-factor authentication and periodically update your password.</p>
<p>• Things become complicated when multiple users attempt to access and control the account at the same time. As the administrator, make sure the only appropriate individuals have access.</p>
<p>• Since you initially set them, you most likely haven&#8217;t checked your privacy settings. It is necessary to examine how your data is shared and how easily accessible it is online.</p>
<p>• Stay away from dangerous links and malicious software. Before installing browser plug-ins and other extensions, always double-check and do some search, regardless of whether the link is from a person you know.</p>
<p>Hackers are constantly improving; therefore you need to stay updated on their strategies. Use the Facebook Help Center to report issues as soon as you can if you run into any.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voice search has been predicted as the future of online search many times over the last decade. Instead of typing, 70% of consumers prefer to ask a voice search query. The number of people using voice search will continue to rise as it becomes more popular. So make your website voice search friendly, or you&#8217;ll lose the majority of your visitors and customers.</p>
<p>Making your website voice-search friendly will aid customers choosing you. With the support of <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/services/search-engine-optimization-marketing/"><strong>SEO Experts in Kochi, Kerala, India</strong></a>, let&#8217;s make sure your SEO plan meets the adaptability of your clients and Google&#8217;s rapidly shifting algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Go For Multilingual</strong></p>
<p>A multilingual website will enable you to reach out to a much larger audience and increase your visibility. With only 25% of internet users speaking English as their first language, it&#8217;s past time to start ministering to the other 75% and being attentive to their requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Test Your Site’s Mobile-Friendliness</strong></p>
<p>More than a quarter (27%) of the worldwide online population is currently using voice search on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Mobile SEO requires responsive design, no pop up ads, a quick loading time, and easy readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use Conversational Keywords/Terms</strong></p>
<p>What is a Conversational Keyword Search, and how does it work? Conversational keyword searches are searches that sound more natural/ real person.  As that is how people speak, you will often encounter them in question form.</p>
<p>Avoid keywords that are too short. Mid-tail and long-tail keywords are much better.  The more exact the keyword, the more probable it is to deliver you a consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Build an FAQ Section</strong></p>
<p>An FAQ page allows you to provide context for the keywords you&#8217;re aiming to rank for as well as satisfy users who have questions.</p>
<p>Keep them accurate but not too lengthy; people expect quick responses, and voice search responses are typically short.</p>
<p><strong>Interact with Users on Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Social media platforms can help you interact with your customers, raise brand awareness, and improve leads and sales.</p>
<p>Many people enjoy and share voice search results on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. Make sure you have active pages. The more you interact with users, the more they will use a virtual assistant to find you afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Boost Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>A user&#8217;s inquiry may be better served by an informative video rather than plain text. If you have any videos to satisfy customers, you may use them for voice search as well; make sure they are properly keyword optimized in order to rank on Google SERPs, as Google already has a separate tab for visible videos that are relevant to users.</p>
<p>Our priority is making sure that your website is willing to welcome your voice-searching visitors no matter where they are. Connect with us to start!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook audiences refer to the people you target when you advertise on Facebook. People wish to see ads that are relevant to them and businesses get greater results when they offer their ads to the right audience. Effective Facebook Ad targeting increases conversions while lowering the cost per conversion—the ultimate measure of an ad’s value. That’s why we analyze how relevant each ad to a person before delivering an ad. eWoke, <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">the top Social Media Marketing Agency in Kochi, Kerala, India</a> provides the best service in managing your ads digitally.</p>
<p>You can target your ad delivery with three audience selection tools in Facebook &#8211; Core Audiences, Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences.</p>
<p>Core Audiences include targeting options such as age, location, gender, interests and much more.  You can target audience by state, locality, zip code and country. Facebook offers a lot of demographic options relating to a population like age, sex, income, marital status, job title and many more. You can add interests and hobbies of the people you want your ad to reach to make your targeted ads more relevant.</p>
<p>Facebook Custom Audiences are feature that enable you to connect with your existing contacts.  Custom Audiences allow you to connect with people who have used your app or visited your website. It allows you to get back in touch with people who have engaged with your business. You are choosing to show your ads to people who have visited your website, or who have looked at specific products. You can also select to omit people who have purchased recently if you believe they are unlikely to convert again in the near future.</p>
<p>Lookalike Audiences allows you to reach new people who are similar to your existing customers. Your ads will show to people with common interests and traits of your existing customers. It builds a list of potential customers who share characteristics of people who have already engaged with your business.</p>
<p>Facebook offers a lot of targeting options. If you add criteria to the &#8220;Include people&#8221; or &#8220;Exclude people&#8221; fields, your audience will include or exclude people according to your option, at least according to one criteria. If you want to include or exclude only people who meet all of your criteria, you can opt for narrow audience option.</p>
<p>Facebook has more than one billion daily active users, so it’s important that you target the right audience. Facebook advertising offers a wide variety of targeting options, including several audience options. So, before you publish your ads to a broader audience, consider the above points to get better conversions.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The WordPress Editor has undergone numerous changes over the years. You may have used the WordPress Classic Editor before switching to the Gutenberg Editor, which is a new block editor. WordPress Gutenberg is the future of content management, and it&#8217;s here now, due to the implementation of WordPress 5.9.</p>
<p>WordPress 5.9 has new font tools, flexible layout options, and finer control over aspects like space, borders, and more to help you polish your website and give it a fresh look. In WordPress 5.9, Gutenberg now offers full site editing capabilities. This means the product can be used in a real-time publishing context.</p>
<p>Let’s go into detail….</p>
<p>Gutenberg requires almost no coding knowledge, making it easier for non-technical users to manage and change WordPress website content. Every change and update no longer necessitates the involvement of a developer.</p>
<p>Opening the Customizer on a new web page in the administrator section was the conventional manner of modifying a WordPress page. With the release of WP 5.9, this is no longer an issue. The site editor, which can be used to enhance the site or a template, has been liberated up in the new version.</p>
<p>Gutenberg is confined within a content block in WordPress. As a result, you should conceive of a block as a form of content. Since other content block plug-ins are incompatible with mobile devices. Gutenberg&#8217;s functionality will be consistent whether you use it on a desktop or mobile device. Not only are the pages you produce with the Gutenberg editor mobile-friendly, but you can also change them while occupied.</p>
<p>WordPress theme developers will be able to design themes for content block sites more quickly. Instead of using a visual editor, the editor will allow native themes to accommodate such layouts. As a result, the software would drastically cut load times for WordPress pages by eliminating the need for heavy content block plug-ins.</p>
<p>The new technology does not go well with all users. Some people require time to decide whether a new technology is worthwhile. However, Gutenberg has been in existence for four years (released on December 2018), so it can be trusted, as it has evolved and been updated throughout time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since search engine optimization is one of the greatest and most successful ways to attract new customers to your website, it&#8217;s vital to keep up with current SEO trends to ensure that your content techniques are effective and generate the intended results.</p>
<p>Some marketers worry about whether SEO is still effective.</p>
<p>It is undeniably significant, and marketing practices will become increasingly important.</p>
<p>Many marketing firms and businesses imply that SEO is more critical right now than anything else because the number of people utilizing the internet has risen in recent months. A company must digitalize its operations and go online if it wants to survive a pandemic like COVID-19.</p>
<p>Despite this, marketing teams have consistently selected SEM as their approach, spending the majority of their advertising and marketing budgets on sponsored ad campaigns. However, current trends indicate that SEO provides a far higher return on investment than PPC.</p>
<p>As the trends are changing frequently, it&#8217;s critical to consult the <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">best SEO Company in Kochi, Kerala</a> to keep your business strategies up to date and fine-tuned.</p>
<p>We have a team of experts at eWoke who can help you optimize your website to improve its search engine ranking as well as reduce the chances of getting penalized by Google.</p>
<p>Here, we are explaining the most recent SEO trends for 2022, which will help you stay competitive.<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Multitask United Model (MUM)</strong></p>
<p>Google has launched a Multitask Unified Model (MUM), which means users won&#8217;t have to do as many searches until they find the right keyword that returns the desired result. MUM can learn from sources in languages other than the one used in the query, allowing it to transmit knowledge between languages. In the user&#8217;s selected language, it can then provide helpful insights and the most relevant results.</p>
<p>What we need to do is generate content that maintains a high level of quality and focus, while also allowing for the opportunities that indirect linking might offer to compare and related topics. You can boost your ranking by using structured data in your online content and prioritizing original and long-form material that addresses the audience&#8217;s pain points.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Friendliness</strong></p>
<p>Since the number of users browsing from smartphones is swiftly expanding and likely to keep on growing, Google is still looking for websites with better optimized and responsive mobile versions. While it is vital to make your site mobile-friendly in order to improve your search rankings, the quality of your site should not be overlooked. Simply ensure that the UX is consistent with the rest of your site and that the page loading performance of your website continues to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Use Long Content</strong></p>
<p>Google prefers sites with a lot more content.</p>
<p>Long form content offers a higher chance of obtaining high-quality backlinks, which help boost search ranks substantially, and it generates three times more traffic than short content. So it’s important that businesses need to provide more shareable information to their targeted customers. You can showcase your expertise while also enhancing your search engine rating by using basic and readable blog content.</p>
<p><strong>Voice Search</strong></p>
<p>Due to recent technological advancements, voice search has become more popular. According to Google, 27% of online users worldwide use voice search on mobile, and half of all smartphone users use voice search technology on a daily basis. 71 % prefer to ask questions via voice rather than typing.</p>
<p>You can start by integrating crucial keywords into your existing content where you can provide concise and relevant answers to difficulties that potential readers may have. This will help you improve your rankings and show off your material in Google Snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Make Use of Video Contents</strong></p>
<p>The importance of video marketing trends in the entire marketing strategy is escalating. According to some estimates, video content will account for 82% of all online traffic by 2022.</p>
<p>Engage your audience with relevant video content offered through multiple social media platforms and use the right keywords to draw people in.</p>
<p>Utilize these elements as a quick reference for boosting the ranking of your website. Also, avoid the <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/completely-outdated-seo-practices-you-should-avoid/">outdated SEO trends in 2021</a> that might harm your business and severely reduce traffic to your website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The findings of Google&#8217;s annual report for 2021 are interesting.  Searches for &#8220;how to heal&#8221; reached an all-time high. All around the world, we were looking for ways to come back even stronger. The most popular searches in the last year have been for health, immunizations, well-being, and helping others. Volunteering piqued the curiosity of a larger number of people. This year, the most popular volunteer opportunity the world searched for was &#8220;vaccination volunteer&#8221;. “How to help Afganistan”, &#8220;how to help Texas”, “how to help Haiti” and “how to honor someone” are the top search terms.</p>
<p>People, as last year, continued to look for methods to stay connected and entertained at home &#8211; &#8220;Squid Game&#8221; topped searches for TV shows to watch this year.</p>
<p>When it related to cultural terms, in times of distress, &#8220;doomscrolling&#8221; is constantly reading social media, anticipating awful news. Despite the fact that the phrase has been around since at least 2018, in January 2021, the world searched for it more than ever. &#8220;Amanda Gorman&#8221; was the most searched poet in the world in 2021 after performing her poem &#8220;The Hill We Climb&#8221; at the United States presidential inauguration. The world wanted to get out and explore this year. When compared to pre-pandemic levels, global interest in &#8220;where can I visit was&#8221; 3X higher in 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soulmate&#8221; was searched more than ever before this year all across the world. Switzerland had the most interest in the search topic this year after deciding to allow &#8220;same-sex marriage&#8221;.</p>
<p>In economic related searches, people looked for &#8220;new entrepreneurship opportunities&#8221; more than it figured out a way to get a job. In September 2021, interest in &#8220;job interviews&#8221; in the United States surpassed pre-pandemic levels. This November, people all across the world tried to shop small. &#8220;Small business Saturday near me&#8221; was a worldwide trend.</p>
<p>People are increasingly concerned about the environment this year, which is why, from huge cities to tropical islands, the world googled the &#8220;impact of climate change&#8221; more than ever this year, with Fiji Googling the most. The popularity of &#8220;sustainability&#8221; searches has risen to unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>This year, more people than ever before searched for affirmations in the area of health and wellbeing, with Kazakhstan having the highest level of interest. And they spent more time than ever had before looking for ways to maintain my mental health. The number of people searching for anxiety, stress, sorrow, and therapy has risen considerably in the last year.</p>
<p>This was the year that interest in &#8220;covid vaccine&#8221; surpassed interest in &#8220;covid testing&#8221; in Google searches. When new vaccine eligibility information was announced in August, global searches for &#8220;when can I get a covid booster&#8221; increased by tenfold compared to searches in July.</p>
<p>In the last week of April, search interest for &#8220;Arun Jaitley Stadium&#8221; peaked during the first leg of the Indian Premier League&#8217;s 14th cricket season. Copa America standings and &#8220;tabla de posiciones copa america 2021&#8221; were breakout searches in 2021 as football fans throughout the world followed the Copa América, with Peru leading the world in search interest. &#8220;How many times has Italy won the Euros&#8221; queries trended for the first time in Trends history in July, when Italy won the UEFA European Championship for the second time. After Neeraj Chopra won the country&#8217;s first 1st place medal in track and field in August, India sought &#8220;gold medals&#8221; harder than ever before.</p>
<p>The world is beginning to mend, according to Google&#8217;s Year in Search report for 2021. We were ecstatic to see live sports, music, and other types of entertainment back. A number of worldwide concerns were also highlighted and we are still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as injustice and environmental change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every industry is recognizing and experiencing the need to adopt a more active approach to its online presence. A strong online presence implies that your service is visible on all major digital platforms, such as search engines, and social media platforms, which are essential for bringing in new patients and keeping old ones. In context of the epidemic, healthcare is a top priority, and many individuals are looking for online solutions.</p>
<p>As a result of this awareness, Trusta, an Omani healthcare brand, engaged eWoke to provide their brand with online exposure. Their product line includes a carefully curated portfolio of high-quality healthcare supplies in the fields of infection prevention, dental, medical, and laboratory.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve launched a website to showcase their services and products to their customers as the first stage in their online journey. Your customers would benefit greatly from an effective website design that includes all essential and important information. The most basic, as well as the most useful, website serves as a simple means of communication between the medical facility and the information seeker. We held a one-on-one discussion with their management team to gather information about their needs and solutions. Our development team built a user-friendly UI and an exceptional website that meets the Board&#8217;s expectations.</p>
<p>Standing solely on the website is not a great marketing plan for expanding your customer base. According to our analysis, many of their competitors have included digital marketing in their plans which includes social media, websites, blogs, and search engine optimization. So, to get ahead of their competitors, our team recommended reinvesting in digital marketing and communication rather than traditional marketing. They realized the competitive position, and we are presently maintaining the client relationship through digital marketing operations.</p>
<p>People are becoming increasingly reliant on numerous internet channels to make decisions, whether it&#8217;s about their healthcare needs or not. As a result, establishing an online foundation for healthcare marketing success is critical.</p>
<p>We at eWoke, the top <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">Web Design &amp; Development, and Digital Marketing Company in Kochi, Kerala</a>, can help you reap the benefits of having an online presence and marketing to increase your brand exposure and audience globally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEO has changed significantly in recent years and is constantly evolving on a daily basis. We used the strategies in the past rapidly became obsolete. Your website may lag behind your competitors in ranks if you don&#8217;t alter your methods as regularly as search engines update their quality requirements.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to remain ahead is to learn new things and be aware of recent updates, but sometimes the true issue is the technique you&#8217;re still doing. Let&#8217;s take a look at some old SEO tactics that will lead you down the wrong path.</p>
<p><strong>Misuse of Keywords</strong></p>
<p>Using keywords without knowing the context, purpose, or theme, and repeating a term in the same post are all out-of-date SEO methods that should be avoided. Because search engine algorithms are now able to detect keyword stuffing and unnatural keyword combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Article Directories &amp; Marketing</strong></p>
<p>There was a time when using article directories and submitting articles to them was a simple approach to improve your ranking. However, time has passed. Everything from the search engine to content directories has been swallowed by the Panda update (2011) and also destroyed low-quality content sites.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Backlinks</strong></p>
<p>Previously, it was common practice to pay rapidly for high-volume backlinks pointing to your website. The backlinks we built now need to be appropriately optimized and maintained. Low-quality domains with an excessive number of backlinks pointing to a website might be harmful to its health. You must earn quality backlinks rather than pay for them to increase your visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Writing for the Web</strong></p>
<p>We should always refer to a subject by its proper name while writing on the web, using variations of the word to ensure that all areas are covered. As previously stated, search engines are advanced in their ability to detect repetitive keywords and negative variations in all content. So, using the term being repeated many times in different versions to improve the ranks is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Article Recreating</strong></p>
<p>Recreating the original material with alternative phrases and words is a black-hat strategy because phrasing tools are incapable of producing excellent content. It is preferable to create articles and blogs manually while retaining the content&#8217;s originality.</p>
<p><strong>Exact Match Keywords &amp; Domains</strong></p>
<p>Targeting exact-match search queries in the expectation of ranking for those queries purely for traffic rather than the search query or its answer actually related to the business and buying exact match domains to deceive the user or use the domain only for the sake of traffic – will cost you badly.</p>
<p>Maintain a valuable domain that is related to the brand name and provide outstanding service/products, and search engines will make your brand visible in relevant contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Pages of Every Keyword Variant</strong></p>
<p>Creating a page for each keyword variant will have a negative impact on users because all the pages will appear the same. Hummingbird, RankBrain, algorithm updates have helped Google comprehend those variations of the same phrase that are all linked to the same topic.</p>
<p><strong>Weak Metadata</strong></p>
<p>Google has now stated that Meta descriptions have no bearing on-page results, although this may not be entirely accurate. While the actual wording of the Meta descriptions may have no bearing on the results, Google does take the number of people that click on your website.</p>
<p>If a person clicks on your link because of the Meta description, it indirectly promotes your SEO efforts and improves the ranking of your website.</p>
<p>It might be challenging to stay up with the current changes in SEO because of the constant adjustments and revisions. If you use outdated SEO strategies for your website, it might become a major issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Connecting with new and potential consumers, especially online, has never been more crucial for businesses.  However, the epidemic days have enticed and encouraged people that they can find whatever they need online. Many already-established industrial giants recognized the value of a digital presence in addition to their traditional marketing techniques.</p>
<p>Zoom BMT, a UAE based leading building materials provider, approached us to create a website for them as the first step towards creating a digital presence.</p>
<p>The first step in developing a strong digital presence to attract new consumers and keep existing ones is to develop a website.

Because the brand belongs to international clients, the website should adhere to international standards and portray the organization and its processes in a user-friendly manner. Our development group designed the user-friendly UI, and created an excellent website that exceeds the Management&#8217;s requirements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Search Engine optimization is getting updated day by day. It is pretty sure that it will not get eliminated within 5 years. Also, it is a great method to improve your brand&#8217;s online visibility and conversions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As people blindly believe what Google suggests, it&#8217;s wise to take effort on SEO as soon as possible. If we follow traditional approaches of SEO rather than updating, we may go down in this competitive platform of Google. Therefore, it&#8217;s pretty good to consult the <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/services/seo-social-media-marketing/">best SEO agency in Kochi </a>for more updated measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some future trends that would play a fuel role in SEO ranking, and let&#8217;s see how important these approaches are beyond 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TF*IDF</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TF*IDF stands for “Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency”. This counts the number of times you use a particular term on a page. TF*IDF also gives some suggestions regarding the optimizations which you can make use of. Content with more TF*IDF weight tends to have a high ranking in Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Focusing More on Mobile SEO Rather than Desktop SEO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traditional SEO is more focused on desktop SEO because people rarely keep smartphones individually in the past years. But now every individual owns their touch phones personally, and desktops are used less compared to mobiles. Therefore, optimizing for mobile is crucial in the coming years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Including More Non-Text Contents</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Non-text content factors include images, Infographics, Graphs, Charts, Videos, Audio clips, Animations, Slideshows, Downloadable files such as PDFs, etc. Including these eye-catching contents could help in increasing the traffic and ranking. This is because people find it disgusting to read the statements and interesting to see the visuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Optimize by Giving More Priority to Voice Search</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s crucial to make changes to your SEO for voice searches. This is because nowadays people are more interested in effortless activities, even in the case of chats; people find it easy to send their voices rather than texting. Thus, voice searches are getting dominant rather than search queries. People communicate with Google as they do with their close ones. So, give importance to terms such as what, why, how, when, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Multi-Channel Digital Marketing Approach</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other digital channels, such as social media, paid media and advertising, PR, and offline marketing, are becoming more intertwined. All of these factors are working together to improve the visibility of your website in Google.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topic Targeting</strong></p>
<p>Keywords are becoming the least priority of Google because it is more focused on topic modeling. Topic modeling is a machine learning technique. It helps in scanning a set of documents, words, phrases, etc, and discovers the abstract topic from a collection of documents.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SEO approaches are getting updated day by day. We must be alert with the new technologies of SEO and its future in order to boost our site ranking. For bidding more techniques and approaches of optimization on to your website reach us at +91 907 238 2964.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot of misunderstanding about the differences between SEO vs. SEM, as well as which is ideal for your business. It can be difficult to comprehend SEO and SEM. Some people aggravate the situation by conflating the two terms. SEO and SEM are mutually beneficial, and this symbiotic relationship can be used to build a strong online presence. However, before you can figure out how to mix them, you must first grasp what each one offers to the marketing space.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the similarities and distinctions between SEO and SEM.</p>
<p><strong>Similarities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drive Quality Traffic</strong> &#8211; SEO &amp; SEM increase the amount of relevant and high-quality traffic that comes to your website. Both techniques promote consumers to visit your website although one is a paid strategy and the other is organic.</p>
<p><strong>Improves Website Online Presence</strong> &#8211; Both strategies will help your site appear in the SERPs by using keyword targeting and optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword Research</strong> &#8211; Keyword research is necessary for SEO and SEM tactics in order to determine what keywords your competitors are targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Optimization</strong> &#8211; To be effective in the long run and offer a decent ROI, both require constant monitoring and optimizations. It&#8217;s also crucial to keep a constant eye on what your competitors are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>
<p><strong>How They Drive Traffic</strong> &#8211; SEO helps your website rank higher in organic search results. SEM, on the other hand, obtains traffic from search engines by using the sponsored area of the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Competition Level</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s quite difficult for a new company to rank for keywords that have already been generated by competitors using SEO. However, with SEM, we can use high-level spending to influence the competition.</p>
<p><strong>How Long It Takes to See Results</strong> &#8211; If the market for the particular industry is competitive. The keywords take a long time to rank and begin producing the intended outcomes. It could take weeks, even months, to see visible results. SEM might help you rank at the top of search results if you invest in sponsored advertising and combine them with accurate descriptions and well-crafted ad copy.</p>
<p><strong>How Much They Cost</strong> &#8211; PPC advertising is costly, and if you don&#8217;t optimize it on a regular basis, you&#8217;ll lose a lot of money. They also necessitate constant funding in order to function. If your advertisements are successful, it makes sense to invest in them, but not if they are losing money. SEO is a completely free service. You can also obtain free backlinks from websites with high domain authority. It is also a cost if you are willing to invest money on analytical tools and sponsored backlinks but not as expensive as SEM.</p>
<p><strong>Make the Right Decision </strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, SEM delivers more leads in the short term; however, SEO is a long-term approach that can transform your consumers into repeat buyers. Each business and its marketing spaces are different. All digital marketing efforts should be properly chosen based on your industry and sector, online competitiveness, short- and long-term goals, budget, and a variety of other factors.</p>
<p>Sometimes the perfect combination of SEO and SEM is the best option for your business. Making a well-informed decision after talking with professionals is valuable. Being the best <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">Digital Marketing Agency in Kochi,</a> we are here to choose the right option for you. Contact our experts today!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHP 7.4 is the most recent minor PHP upgrade. As with each version, new features have been added, and some changes have been made. PHP 7.4 includes several enhancements that might help you optimize your web pages and improve the user experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, today we will go through some of the most exciting additions and changes that PHP 7.4 will bring.</p>
<p><strong>What’s New in PHP 7.4?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of the changes can be made without compromising the functionality of your site. However, some modifications may have an impact on your existing framework. You can see if your codebase is affected by this list of backward-incompatible modifications.</p>
<p><strong>1. Arrow Functions                          </strong></p>
<p>Arrow functions, often known as &#8220;short closures,&#8221; allow you to write single-line functions. The new syntax improves the language significantly, allowing us to write more understandable and manageable code. The web development process will run faster as a result of your ability to write neater, shorter code, helping you to save time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Preloading</strong></p>
<p>This new feature aims to improve PHP 7.4 performance. The server can load the requested code files into shared memory via preloading. When a request reaches the server, it can now access sections of the codebase that were already loaded in memory without incurring any additional effort.</p>
<p><strong>3. Typed Properties</strong></p>
<p>You can assign a type to all class properties using typed properties. When a type is specified, the PHP engine prevents the class property from being set to a different type. PHP developers can use typed properties, such as arrow functions, to make their code shorter and cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>4. Weak References</strong></p>
<p>The Weak Reference method in PHP 7.4 allows web developers to save a link to an object that does not prevent it from being destroyed. They can more easily implement cache-like structures due to this capability.</p>
<p>Numerous new PHP capabilities significantly improve PHP 7.4 performance by reducing memory usage. You will be able to avoid some of this programming language&#8217;s past constraints, write cleaner code, and construct web solutions faster.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for PHP 7.4 Migration</strong></p>
<p>If you are still running in lower versions of PHP, now is the time to consider upgrading to PHP 7.4. You can test the latest PHP version this way before updating your real website. Let&#8217;s have a look at a few recommendations for preparing for the PHP 7.4 transition.</p>
<p>To figure out what you&#8217;ll need to do before updating, it&#8217;s important to know what PHP version you&#8217;re running. The phpinfo() function, which prints different information about the PHP server, including its version, is the most trustworthy approach to find out what version of PHP is used for that specific website.</p>
<p>To test compatibility, use a tool like PHP Compatibility Checker. You can use this tool to test your website with a different PHP version. Once you install, activate, and use this plugin, it will alert you if any compatibility issues need to be solved before upgrading.</p>
<p>Web hosting companies will begin upgrading sites that use older PHP versions to the new standard version, which removes all security and support from the server. So, switching to a hosting company that handles PHP conversion is one of the most efficient ways to prepare.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re all set for the upcoming migration, which will make your website safer and faster. If you require any additional information or assistance, please contact us.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>PHP is utilized on more than 78.9% of all websites. The year 2020 will be notable for PHP.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHP is utilized on more than 78.9% of all websites. The year 2020 will be notable for PHP. On November 26, 2020, the much-anticipated PHP 8 was released, introducing several breaking changes from prior versions. PHP 7.4 is the most recent stable version. It&#8217;s the last version before PHP 8 and was released on November 28, 2019.</p>
<p>Even though PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 are no longer officially supported, many websites still use them. It&#8217;s been the most recent and exciting development in the PHP business for quite some time. Although it is currently supported by many PHP-based frameworks and content management systems (CMS), it is not supported by all. However, it is now time to modify the concept.</p>
<p><strong>1. Why the update is important?</strong></p>
<p>Top web hosting companies including SiteGround, Bluehost, and Hostwinds have already notified their clients that as of June 21, 2021, they would begin phasing out PHP 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 5.6, and lower on their servers.</p>
<p>This is necessary since all PHP versions below 7.4 are no longer supported in terms of security, and utilizing such a version puts your site and servers in danger. The web hosting companies will begin upgrading sites utilizing previous PHP versions to the new default version &#8211; PHP 7.4, and PHP 7.4 below versions will no longer be accessible for use on these servers by December 31, 2021.</p>
<p>This update, not only will improve your site&#8217;s efficiency, but it will also make it more secure against security flaws discovered in older versions of PHP. Before you upgrade your site, ensure sure it&#8217;s compatible with the PHP version you wish to use and that you have a backup.</p>
<p><strong>2. How will your website be affected when PHP is updated?</strong></p>
<p>That depends on how you&#8217;ve built your website. If your site is created with HTML, like Website Builder, then the PHP update has no effect at all.</p>
<p>If your site is created with PHP and the code is compatible with the new PHP version, your website will function the same or better. If you use a CMS like WordPress, you can probably notice some improvements in performance, provided you have updated WordPress to the latest version.</p>
<p>If you use code that is outdated and not supported in the new version of PHP, then your site will give errors and may stop working altogether. For example, if you haven&#8217;t updated your CMS to the latest version, or if your website uses custom code, for which an update isn&#8217;t readily available. In that case, you need to update the code to make it compatible.</p>
<p>If you suspect that your site contains outdated code, it&#8217;s very important that you take the time to update your site, before older PHP versions are removed from your servers. It&#8217;s easier to fix things, if your site is still working, and you are able to switch between older PHP versions.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the risks if you don’t update?</strong></p>
<p>If you host your E-commerce site on a web server that doesn&#8217;t support PHP 7.4, your site&#8217;s security could be jeopardized at any time. As a result, you won&#8217;t be able to ensure that your information is secure. Nobody can guarantee that your website will not be hacked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crucial — else, your site&#8217;s speed won&#8217;t improve. The truth is that using the most recent PHP versions will significantly speed up your site.<br />
When it comes to a WordPress site, many free and paid plug-ins are using, so, a single line of faulty code can create an error. The first step is to rule out the possibility that the problem is caused by a plug-in or theme. To accomplish this, deactivate all of your WordPress plug-ins and switch to the default WordPress theme.<br />
The vast majority of Magento websites in the world are still using an unsupported PHP version. If you are using anything older than version 7.4, you are probably missing out on some performance gains. But, more crucially, you are putting your website at risk of potential security flaws.</p>
<p><strong>4. What are the benefits of updating?</strong></p>
<p>Better security &#8211; The most obvious reason to update is security. Newer versions are better at countering hackers, for example, because deprecated (outdated) code is no longer supported.</p>
<p>Faster websites &#8211; Newer PHP versions are faster. PHP 7.4 is significantly faster than the previous versions, and with faster execution times and less memory usage, especially WordPress sites will benefit.</p>
<p>New features and improvements &#8211; As with all updates, a newer version includes new features and improvements on how to do things, for example, preloading.</p>
<p>If you require any additional information or support, please do not hesitate to contact us. As the <a href="https://www.ewokesoft.com/">best web development company in Kochi</a>, we can assist you in resolving this issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted almost everyone&#8217;s way of life in some way. It caused us to distance ourselves from others, wash our hands more often, and developed a habit of wearing masks. Many people were prepared to work from home for the first time as a result of the public health threat. Businesses from various sectors have a significant link with COVID-19, particularly after authorities forced non-essential businesses to close temporarily and mandated that all others adopt new health and safety procedures. Many businesses are having problems with money management, employee and client management, and other concerns.</p>
<p>In these odd times, there is no universal solution for companies, but now there are some options for a better, more sustainable future. One of the newest techniques you can implement is social media marketing. More than at any other time in recent history, social media platforms have dominated newspapers as the primary source of information. In addition, the current situation (COVID-19) has acted as a basis for the growing use of social media.</p>
<p>According to Google, there are approximately 3.96 billion active users on different social media platforms. Facebook is used by 2.80 billion people, while Instagram is used by 1.074 billion people. Since such numerous people use social media sites, why should you wait to use them to promote your business?</p>
<p><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>Do some research, reach out to influencers who connect to your customer base, and do whatever it takes to put yourself in your customers&#8217; hands. This in-depth understanding of your customers will guide everything you do during and after a crisis like COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Explore New Things</strong></p>
<p>If you want to expand your brand across several channels, now is the time to do so. Experiment with different content styles, such as video. User-generated content will assist you in engaging your customers. Try out some new interactive features that platforms have introduced, such as polls on Instagram and Facebook. Maintain interaction with customers and serve as a source of motivation, entertainment, and information.</p>
<p><strong>Try Influencer Marketing and Other Paid Activities</strong></p>
<p>Brand recognition can be increased by collaborating with the right influencers. Using paid advertising on the platforms will also help you develop your customer base. In comparison to other digital advertisements, social media ads are considered more personalized, and engaging.</p>
